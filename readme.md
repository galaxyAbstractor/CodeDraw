This is CodeDraw, a simple one-day project I did in highschool in 2011. The code is rather meh, no comments, old. Features are missing.

Based on the idea by: http://i.imgur.com/QlGpd.gif by reddit user Overv
It takes what you type in the text area, converts each character to it's number, creates pixels from them, draws them on a canvas and
saves it in .bmp format. Opening the bmp file in a text editor will let you see the text as if it were a text file. It's pretty
useless but still a fun project at the time.

Features implemented:
- Convert text to bitmap
- Draw it in a canvas
- Save

Features not implemented:
- Loading
- Scrolling the canvas when lots of text
- Checking if inputted characters can be converted to save in bitmap (Ex: Asian chars are outside the color range)

Feel free to do whatever with this.
